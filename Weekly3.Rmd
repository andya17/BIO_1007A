### I will aim to reconstruct this figure (1B) in [Drolet et al. (2015)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24432314.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A9c46a2d9bd6552f69aa40f3895a2613b&ab_segments=&origin=&acceptTC=1).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

expert = read.table(file="Data/drolet.csv", header=T, sep=",")

# I changed the names of the columns in the .xlsx file that was downloaded so they would be less unwieldy; they showed as multiple words with dots between them when I imported them previously. I would like to convert a column that had 0s and 1s into the description of the variable, which had been included in the column title by the researchers. 
expert$Outcome <- as.character(expert$Outcome)
expert$Outcome[which(expert$Outcome=="0")] <- "Non-eradication"
expert$Outcome[which(expert$Outcome=="1")] <- "Eradication"

# I am grouping by two variables so that they both show up in the summary.            
expertdata = expert %>%
  select(Prediction, Outcome) %>%
  group_by(Prediction, Outcome) %>%
  summarize(TotalNumber=n())

expertdata$Outcome <-factor(expertdata$Outcome, levels=c("Non-eradication", "Eradication"))

expertdata$Prediction <- factor(expertdata$Prediction, levels=c("Very unlikely", "Unlikely", "Likely", "Very likely"))

p <- ggplot(data=expertdata, 
       aes(x=expertdata$Prediction, y=expertdata$TotalNumber, fill=factor(Outcome))) +   geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity", width=0.5, color="black") +
  ylab("Count") +
  xlab("") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,10,20,30,40,50,60), limits=c(0,60)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Very unlikely", "Unlikely", "Likely", "Very likely")) +
  theme_few() + scale_fill_grey(start=0.99, end=0.7) +
  theme(legend.position="top", legend.title= element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="black", angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(colour="black")) + 
  theme(legend.position = c(.85, .85)) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=2,byrow=TRUE)) 

print(p)

# Neither annotate() or geom_text() seemed to work with putting the "B" in the top left corner. I tried annotating it, but it accepted an x value, so I was forced to put in "Very unlikely." This made the B appear far more to the right than I wanted.
# Additionally, I could not find a legend key shape that matched what the researchers had, so I left that argument out.
